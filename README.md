# HomeSmart 📱

HomeSmart is a landing page website created using HTML, TailwindCSS, and JS. This is my first website using TailwindCSS, and it was created following a tutorial. This website is an excellent repository if you want to start using TailwindCSS. 

## ✨ Features

- Responsive design
- Dark/White modes
- User disability friendly
- Hamburger menu created using JS (personal choice taken as a challenge 😄)
